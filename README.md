# Personal-Brand-Website
A website to promote me as a web developer. Basic layout with a CSS and HTML. Images stored in the IMGS while my Resume is stored in my attached files. I set a fixed background and made a background for my welcome div, making the illusion of a still image under another. To fix the font errors I used text shadow to the fourth degree to create an outline effect to the text, thus making it easier to read on lighter surfaces. Grid was used in certain locations to make it easier to position.
