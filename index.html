      <h3>Hello and welcome to my page. I am Chris Lima, a Software Engineer with 3 months experience based in Florida. I am available for both remote and in person work. Ever since I made a house made of boxes when young child I had become obsessed with creating things. Be it my roles on my high school robotics team, or my works in the creative writing club, and now as a developer. I wish to bring my passion to create to your future projects.</h3>
